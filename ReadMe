Key Changes for Template Selection:
Template Folder:

We assume that you have a templates/ folder containing .pptx files (your templates) and preview image files (e.g., .png, .jpg) for each template.
Template Selection:

A radio button (st.radio) is used to allow the user to select one of the templates.
After selecting a template, the app will display the corresponding preview image using st.image.
Loading Template:

Based on the user's selection, the corresponding .pptx file is loaded and used to generate the presentation.
The first slide of the selected template is used as the title slide, and subsequent slides are added to it.
Progress Bar:

The progress bar is updated in stages, from content generation to chart creation and presentation download.
How to Use:
Template Files:

Put your .pptx templates in the templates/ folder.
Place corresponding preview images (e.g., template1_preview.png) in the same folder.
Run the Streamlit App:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Select Template:

In the app, you will see a list of available templates with a preview image.
After entering a topic, the app will generate content and generate the presentation based on the selected template.
Download:

Once the presentation is ready, you can download the PowerPoint file.
Notes:
Make sure the .pptx templates you use are compatible with python-pptx and have a consistent structure.
Ensure that the preview images are correctly named and placed in the folder.
